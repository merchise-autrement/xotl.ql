========================
The Expressions Language
========================

This module provides the building blocks for query expressions.

This module provides several classes that represent the operations themselves,
this classes does not attempt to provide anything else than what it's deem
needed to have an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Each expression is represented by an instance of an ExpressionTree. An
expression tree has two core attributes:

- The :attr:`~ExpressionTree.operation` attribute contains a reference to the
  any of the classes that derive from :class:`Operator`.

- The :attr:`~ExpressionTree.children` attribute always contains a tuple
  with objects to which the operation is applied.

Operation classes should have the following attributes:

- `_arity`, which can be any of :class:`N_ARITY`, :class:`BINARY`, or
  :class:`UNARY`.

- `_format`, which should be a string that specifies how to format the
  operation when str is invoked to print the expression. The format should
  conform to the format mini-language as specified in Python's string module
  doc.

  For UNARY operations it will be passed a single positional argument. For
  BINARY two positional arguments will be passed. N_ARITY is regarded as
  function on several arguments (passed one after the other separated by
  commas); `_format` should have a single positional argument that will be
  replaced by the list of arguments.

- `_method_name`, should contain a string (not unicode unless you're sure) with
  the name of the method that is be invoked on the (first) operand of the
  expression when this operation is used.

  This attribute simply maps operations to methods. This allows us to make
  expressions "composable", since expression trees will always have a "default"
  implementation of those methods, that normaly just buils another expression
  tree with it's `op` set to the operation.

This module provides operations for several of the commonly used in expression:
arithmetical, testing for containment, and others. So, expression are
composable::

    >>> expr1 = eq(1, 2) & eq(2, 3)
    >>> str(expr1)
    '(1 == 2) and (2 == 3)'

.. note:: We use `&` for the `and` operation, and `|` for the `or` operation.
          The "real" interpretation of "and" and "or" is not given in this
          module, but is left to the "compilation" phase. They may be regarded
          as logical or bitwise operations as well.



Objects in expressions
----------------------

In order to have any kind of objects in expressions, we provide a very ligth-
weight transparent wrapper :class:`q`. This simple receives an object as
it's wrapped, and pass every attribute lookup to is wrapped object but also
implements the creation of expressions with the supported operations. The
expression above could be constructed like::

    >>> expr2 = (q(1) == q(2)) & (q(2) == q(3))
    >>> str(expr2)
    '(1 == 2) and (2 == 3)'


The class :class:`q` contains more detailed information.


Contexts of execution
---------------------

Since the default operations of Python are "trapped" to build other expressions
as shown with::

    >>> expr1 == expr2    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <expression '...' at 0x...>

it's difficult to test whether or not two expressions are equivalent, meaning
only that they represent the same AST and not its semantics. We use the simple
contexts of execution provided by :mod:`!xoutil.context` to enter "special"
modes of execution in which we change the semantic of an operation.

Since, :class:`q` is based on :mod:`!xoutil.proxy` we use the same context name
the proxy module uses for similar purposes, i.e, to enter a special context in
which operation don't create new expression but try to evaluate themselve; such
a context is the object :class:`~xotl.ql.proxy.UNPROXIFING_CONTEXT`::

    >>> from xoutil.context import context
    >>> from xoutil.proxy import UNPROXIFING_CONTEXT
    >>> with context(UNPROXIFING_CONTEXT):
    ...    expr1 == expr2
    True

.. warning::

   We only provide implementations for `__eq__` and `__ne__`, other operations
   will *probably* (but not always) fail in this context::

        >>> with context(UNPROXIFING_CONTEXT):    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        ...    q(1) + q(2) + expr1
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        RuntimeError: ...

   Only use `==` or `!=` in this context!


The case for `q`-objects
------------------------

`q`-objects are just meant to provide a simple wrapper for objects that don't
support the operations of expressions directly. They are not meant to be used
everywhere. Notice that expressions support most common operations and their
"reverses", so sometimes `q`-objects are not required::

    >>> 1 + q(1)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <expression '1 + 1' at 0x...>

For the time being, we keep the q-objects and they allows to test our
expression language. But, in time, we may refactor this class out of this
module.

Thougths on Query Languages
---------------------------

Expressions are the core for query languages and many of it's design decisions
are strongly biased for query languages needs. But they purpose is more
general. Notice that :class:`this objects <xotl.ql.core.These>` are
they way to specify the selected data in queries.

The ultimate goal of expressions is to be *compiled* into forms feasible to the
current database (either relational or not) management systems. For instance,
it would be desirable that on top of CouchDB_ (or Couchbase_) expressions would
be *translated* to Couch's views if possible.

There's a good article [Buneman]_ that describe several features of a UnQL
(Unstructured Query Language), that are of interest to this module. Another
article exposes the relation between NoSQL and SQL, and renames the former as
coSQL following the categorical tradition since NoSQL is *dual* to SQL
[Meijer2011]_ [Fokkinga2012]_.

In this article [Meijer2011]_, the authors only focused on key-value stores for
noSQL databases. Although they claim that:

    While we donâ€™t often think of it this way, the RAM for storing object
    graphs is actually a key-value store where keys are addresses (l-values)
    and values are the data stored at some address in memory
    (r-values). Languages such as C# and Java make no distinction between
    r-values and l-values, unlike C or C++, where the distinction is
    explicit. In C, the pointer dereference operator ``*p`` retrieves the value
    stored at address ``p`` in the implicit global store.

Just as LINQ does for C#, one of the goals of the expression language its to
allow the construction of "natural" or better, idiomatic queries. Here the term
idiomatic, it's best cast a the natural idiom for the Object Model Canonical
Form (OMCaF) we're developing in :mod:`xotl.models`.

But the expression language cannot express the whole of queries. Real queries
require of:

- The SELECTION part, that identifies the data we want to retrieve. Sometimes,
  this part also transforms the data.

- And the SOURCE, that identifies the datastore we want to query.

- Optionally, a FILTER may be given to only retrieve data that match a
  criterion.

In addition, we often find:

- ORDER instructions to retrieve data in a given orden.
- OFFSET and LIMIT bounds to retrieve just a portion of the data.

The natural fit for expressions is the FILTER part. But we can also use the
same underlying AST mechanism to:

- Express the SELECTION part: `this.age` is a valid expression but is also a
  valid selector, and `count(1) + 100` is also a valid transform-making
  selector and a well-formed expression::

      >>> count(1) + 100    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      <expression '(count(1)) + 100' at 0x...>

- Express the ORDER part. This can be done with unary operators::

      >>> (+q('age'), -count(q('children')))    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      (<expression '+age'...>, <expression '-(count(children))...>)

.. note::

    Since `this` objects may have schemas bound to them, it's possible to bias
    the compiled expression to a given target. In fact, `this` instances may
    have whole expressions as bindings (constrains) and the fact the it refers
    to a given *kind* of object (and that the given kind has a schema
    associated to it) it's merely eventual.


About the operations supported in expression
--------------------------------------------

Almost any operation is supported by expressions. :class:`ExpressionTree`
uses the known :ref:`python protocols <py:datamodel>` to allow the composition
of expressions using an natural (or idiomatic) form, so::

    expression <operator> object

are the *suggested* form for constructing expressions. Doing so, allows other
objects (see the :mod:`~xotl.ql.core` module for example) to engage
into expressions and keeps the feeling of naturality.

The ``<operator>`` can be any of the supported operations, i.e:

- All the arithmetical operations, except `pow(a, b, modulus)` with a non-None
  `modulus`, but `a ** b` **is** supported.

- The ``&``, ``|``, and ``^`` operations. This are proposed to replace the
  `and`, `or`, and `xor` logical operations; but its true meaning is dependent
  of the :term:`expression translator <query translator>`.

- All the comparation operations: ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``==``, and
  ``!=``.

- The unary operators for ``abs``, ``+``, ``-``, and ``~``. We **don't**
  support ``len``.

- The operators for testing containment ``__contains__``.

Extending the expressions language
----------------------------------

The expression language may be extended by introducing new
:term:`function object operators <function object operator>`. For
instance, one may need an average function::

   >>> from xotl.ql.expressions import FunctorOperator
   >>> class AverageFunction(FunctorOperator):
   ...     '''
   ...     The ``avg(*args)`` operation.
   ...     '''
   ...     _format = 'avg({0})'
   ...     _arity = N_ARITY
   ...     _method_name = b'_avg'
   >>> avg = Average Function

Given such a definition, now the `avg` callable produces expressions::

  >>> avg(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  <expression 'avg(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)' ...>

Furthermore, you can even customize the way the expression is built by
implementing the `_avg` method on some specially averaged object::

  >>> class ZeroObject(object):
  ...    def _avg(self, *others):
  ...        if others:
  ...            return avg(*others)
  ...        else:
  ...            from xotl.ql.expressions import q
  ...            return q(0)

  >>> zero = ZeroObject()
  >>> avg(zero, 1, 2, 3)     # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  <expression 'avg(1, 2, 3)' ...>

  >>> avg(zero)
  '0'
