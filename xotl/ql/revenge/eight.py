'''Utility for defining methods variants.

Method variants allow several implementations of a single method to be chosen
given several conditions are met *when the module/class is being created*.
Notice this is not dynamic dispatching Ã  la functional programming.

    If the predicated given by `pred` is True, the `target` is returned, but
    gains an `override` method to allowing chaining of overrides.

    The last defined `override` that matches `pred` wins.

    Intended usage::

        @override(py27)
        def foobar(x):
            print(x, 'Python 2.7')

        @foobar.override(prepy27)   # In python 2.7, keeps the previous def
        def foobar(x):
           print(x, 'An older python')

        @foobar.override(py30)
        def foobar(x):
            print(x, 'Python 3.0 but not bigger')

        @foobar.override(py3k)  # shadows the previous definition
        def foobar(x):
           print(x, 'Any python 3')


    .. warning:: This is not dynamic dispatching.  The predicated is evaluated
       only at function creation the returned function is thus, the variant
       that matched its predicate or the `unimplemented`:class: stub.
