'''This module provides the building blocks for query expressions.

This module provides several classes that represent the operations themselves,
this classes does not attempt to provide anything else than what it's deem
needed to have an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Each expression is represented by an instance of an ExpressionTree. An
expression tree has two core attributes:

- The :py:attr:`~ExpressionTree.op` attribute contains a reference to the any
  of the classes that derive from :class:`Operator`.

- The :py:attr:`~ExpressionTree.children` attribute always contains a tuple
  with objects to which the operation is applied.

Operation classes should have the following attributes:

- `_arity`, which can be any of :py:class:`AT_LEAST_TWO`, :py:class:`BINARY`,
  or :py:class:`UNARY`.

- `_format`, which should be a string that specifies how to format the
  operation when str is invoked to print the expression. The format should
  conform to the format mini-language as specified in Python's string module
  doc.

  For UNARY operations it will be passed a single positional argument. For
  BINARY two positional arguments will be passed. AT_LEAST_TWO are currently
  BINARY operations that should have a boolean `_associative` attribute. The
  `_format` attribute should contains the format for two operands. We will
  concat the result with or without parenthesis according to the truth value of
  `_associative`.

- `_associative`, as explained above.

- `_method_name`, should contain a string (not unicode unless you're sure) with
  the name of the method that is be invoked on the (first) operand of the
  expression when this operation is used.

  This attribute simply maps operations to methods. This allows us to make
  expressions "composable", since expression trees will always have a "default"
  implementation of those methods, that normaly just buils another expression
  tree with it's `op` set to the operation.

This module provides operations for several of the commonly used in expression:
arithmetical, testing for containment, and others. So, expression are
composable::

    >>> expr1 = eq(1, 2) & eq(2, 3)
    >>> str(expr1)
    '(1 == 2) and (2 == 3)'

.. note:: We use `&` for the `and` operation, and `|` for the `or` operation.
          The "real" interpretation of "and" and "or" is not given in this
          module, but is left to the "compilation" phase. They may be regarded
          as logical or bitwise operations as well.



Objects in expressions
----------------------

In order to have any kind of objects in expressions, we provide a very ligth-
weight transparent wrapper :py:class:`q`. This simple receives an object as
it's wrapped, and pass every attribute lookup to is wrapped object but also
implements the creation of expressions with the supported operations. The
expression above could be constructed like::

    >>> expr2 = (q(1) == q(2)) & (q(2) == q(3))
    >>> str(expr2)
    '(1 == 2) and (2 == 3)'


The class :py:class:`q` contains more detailed information.


Contexts of execution
---------------------

Since the default operations of Python are "trapped" to build other expressions
as shown with::

    >>> expr1 == expr2    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <expression '...' at 0x...>

it's difficult to test whether or not two expressions are equivalent, meaning
only that they represent the same AST and not its semantics. We use the simple
contexts of execution provided by :py:mod:`!xoutil.context` to enter
"special" modes of execution in which we change the semantic of an operation.

Since, :py:class:`q` is based on :py:mod:`xoutil.proxy`, and it's
likely that expressions contains `q`-objects, we use the same context name, the
proxy uses for similar purposes, i.e, :class:`~xotl.ql.proxy.UNPROXIFING_CONTEXT`::

    >>> from xoutil.context import context
    >>> from xoutil.proxy import UNPROXIFING_CONTEXT
    >>> with context(UNPROXIFING_CONTEXT):
    ...    expr1 == expr2
    True

.. warning::

   We only provide implementations for `__eq__` and `__ne__`, other operations
   will *probably* (but not always) fail in this context::

        >>> with context(UNPROXIFING_CONTEXT):    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        ...    q(1) + q(2) + expr1
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        RuntimeError: ...

   Only use `==` or `!=` in this context!


The case for `q`-objects
------------------------

`q`-objects are just meant to provide a simple wrapper for objects that don't
support the operations of expressions directly. They are not meant to be used
everywhere. Notice that expressions support most common operations and their
"reverses", so sometimes `q`-objects are not required::

    >>> 1 + q(1)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <expression '1 + 1' at 0x...>

For the time being, we keep the q-objects and they allows to test our
expression language. But, in time, we may refactor this class out of this
module.


.. autoclass:: q

Thougths on Query Languages
---------------------------

Expressions are the core for query languages and many of it's design decisions
are strongly biased for query languages needs. But they purpose is more
general. Notice that :py:class:`this objects <xotl.ql.these.These>` are
they way to specify the selected data in queries.

The ultimate goal of expressions is to be *compiled* into forms feasible to the
current database (either relational or not) management systems. For instance,
it would be desirable that on top of CouchDB_ (or Couchbase_) expressions would
be *translated* to Couch's views if possible.

There's a good article [Buneman]_ that describe several features of a UnQL
(Unstructured Query Language), that are of interest to this module. Another
article exposes the relation between NoSQL and SQL, and renames the former as
coSQL following the categorical tradition since NoSQL is *dual* to SQL
[Meijer2011]_ [Fokkinga2012]_.

In this article [Meijer2011]_, the authors only focused on key-value stores for
noSQL databases. Although they claim that:

    While we donâ€™t often think of it this way, the RAM for storing
    object graphs is actually a key-value store where keys are
    addresses (l-values) and values are the data stored at some
    address in memory (r-values). Languages such as C# and Java
    make no distinction between r-values and l-values, unlike C or
    C++, where the distinction is explicit. In C, the pointer
    dereference operator ``\*p`` retrieves the value stored at address ``p`` in
    the implicit global store.

Just as LINQ does for C#, one of the goals of the expression language its to
allow the construction of "natural" or better, idiomatic queries. Here the term
idiomatic, it's best cast a the natural idiom for the Object Model Canonical
Form (OMCaF) we're developing in :py:mod:`xotl.models`.

But the expression language cannot express the whole of queries. Real queries
require of:

- The SELECTION part, that identifies the data we want to retrieve. Sometimes,
  this part also transforms the data.

- And the SOURCE, that identifies the datastore we want to query.

- Optionally, a FILTER may be given to only retrieve data that match a
  criterion.

In addition, we often find:

- ORDER instructions to retrieve data in a given orden.
- OFFSET and LIMIT bounds to retrieve just a portion of the data.

The natural fit for expressions is the FILTER part. But we can also use the
same underlying AST mechanism to:

- Express the SELECTION part: `this.age` is a valid expression but is also a
  valid selector, and `count(1) + 100` is also a valid transform-making
  selector and a well-formed expression::

      >>> count(1) + 100    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      <expression '(count(1)) + 100' at 0x...>

- Express the ORDER part. This can be done with unary operators::

      >>> (+q('age'), -count(q('children')))    # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
      (<expression '+age'...>, <expression '-(count(children))...>)

.. note::

    Since `this` objects may have schemas bound to them, it's possible to bias
    the compiled expression to a given target. In fact, `this` instances may
    have whole expressions as bindings (constrains) and the fact the it refers
    to a given *kind* of object (and that the given kind has a schema
    associated to it) it's merely eventual.


About the operations supported in expression
--------------------------------------------

Almost any operation is supported by expressions. :class:`ExpressionTree`
uses the known :ref:`python protocols <py:datamodel>` to allow the composition
of expressions using an natural (or idiomatic) form, so::

    expression <operator> object

are the *suggested* form for constructing expressions. Doing so, allows other
objects (see the :mod:`~xotl.ql.these` module for example) to engage
into expressions and keeps the feeling of naturality.

The ``<operator>`` can be any of the supported operations, i.e:

- All the arithmetical operations, except `pow(a, b, modulus)` with a non-None
  `modulus`, but `a ** b` **is** supported.

- The ``&``, ``|``, and ``^`` operations. This are proposed to replace the
  `and`, `or`, and `xor` logical operations; but it's true meaning is dependant
  of the *expression compiler*.

- All the comparation operations: ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``==``, and
  ``!=``.

- The unary operators for ``abs``, ``+``, ``-``, and ``~``. We **don't**
  support ``len``.

- The operators for testing containment ``__contains__``.

    The base class for operations that are invoked explictly by the programmer.

    Some operations like (:class:`count`, :class:`is_a`, etc.) are not called
    implicitly by Python and you must use them as "functions". So any
    customization you make to an object's method for the expression are not
    invoked by Python implicitly as it does for other operators.

    For instance, if you write a class `X` that defines both a `__add__` and
    `count` methods, when an expression ``instance_of_X + y`` is parsed, Python
    will call the `__add__` method and you may customize the way expressions
    are done for object of type `X`. But when ``count(instance_of_X)`` is
    parsed Python won't call the `count` method of `X`.

    This class adds such behavior. Operations that are always invoked
    explicitly by the programmer instead of Python's implicit invokation
    protocol, **should** inherit from this class. We take steps to prevent
    infinity recursion if an operand implements a protocol but calls the
    operator to build the final expression.

# XXXX: Removed the auto-mutable feature of expressions. Expressions should be
# regarded as immutable.

#    Auto-mutating expressions was a bad idea conceived to resolve the
#    case of `this` in the context of comprehensions like::
#
#        >>> next(parent for parent in this
#        ...        if (parent.age > 20) & parent.children)
#
#    It was thougth that this would return the expression as modified by
#    the conditions placed. But after more cases were proposed this was
#    shown wrong; in adition the design was getting too ugly.
#
#    Idioms like::
#
#        # Fetch the ages of parents that have more than two children.
#        >>> fetch(parent.age for parent in this
#        ...           if length(parent.children) > 2)
#
#    Here there are two elements that are different:
#
#    - The SELECT data that we need
#    - The CONDITIONS upon that data.
#
#    Auto-mutating expressions could not express the SELECT part of this
#    example.
#
#    So there are two possible solutions:
#
#    - Make `this` instances have a `binding` property that *do*
#      automutate in the context of comprehensions.
#
#    - Make `These.__iter__` return another kind of object.
#
#    We're currently exploring the first option, since the second
#    requires another type of object, that behaves like These, but have:
#
#    - CONDITIONS
#    - ORDERING?
#    - OFFSET and LIMIT
